\title{Make a tibble of h_nr values from a tibble of symptom onset and reporting
dates}
\usage{
make_h_nr_df(input)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{tibble containing columns `reported_date`, `symptom_onset_date`
(both dates) and `time_to_report` (numeric)}
}
\value{
tibble with columns `n`, `r` and `h_nr`
}
\description{
Given a tibble (such as `delay_data`) with columns `reported_date`,
 `symptom_onset_date` (both dates) and `time_to_report` (numeric), create
 a tibble with columns `n` (symptom onset day), `r` (day of reporting) and
 `h_nr` (number of cases whose symptoms started on day `n` and case was
 reported on day `r`). Day start at 0, so $n, r \geq 0$. Do not need zero
 `h_nr` counts, so this is a bit easier to work with than the matrix form.
TODO Needs expanding for ICU and hospitalisation data.
